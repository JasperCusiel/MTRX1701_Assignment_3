# MTRX1701_Assignment_3

1. This assignment is worth 10% of your final mark in MTRX1701.
2. This assignment may be completed in groups of 2-3. You must register your group
members from within your tutorial session in Canvas to help us manage the submissions.
Include the SID of all group members on your submission title page.
3. You will have the opportunity to ask the tutors for assistance during the tutorial sessions
in weeks 7-9. You should spend approximately one hour preparing for each of these
tutorials so that you can benefit fully from them.
4. The tutors will not assist you further unless you can provide real evidence you have
attempted the questions prior to the tutorials. Beyond the tutorial sessions, it is
estimated that you will need two to three hours per week to complete the assignment
(20 hours total).
5. You may discuss the assignment with your peers, however all written work submitted for
assessment must be strictly prepared by your group.
6. All work must be completed electronically (typed) including all diagrams.
7. Total marks for this assignment is 100.
Assignment Submission
1. Submit your assignment electronically as a PDF file via the “Assignments” page on the
MTRX1701 Canvas site.
2. The assignment is due at 11:59 pm, Friday May 4th (end of week 9).
3. Late submission will be penalised by deducting 5% of the maximum mark for each
calendar day after the due date. Zero will be awarded after ten calendar days late.
4. Submit early enough to ensure that your submission is processed by 11:59 pm.
5. Keep the email that will be generated automatically by the system as proof of your
submission.
# Context of the Assignment
Analysis and synthesis: There are at least two complementary aspects to the practice of
engineering. One could be described as an understanding of how things (machines, structures,
systems, etc.) work and how they can be put together from components. This is called
“synthesis” or “design”. Another aspect of engineering is the need to perform mathematical or
computer calculations that allow something (integrity, safety, reliability, cost, etc.) to be
demonstrated. This is “analysis”. You will all have both of these abilities to a greater of lesser
extent and we will help you to develop them a lot further over the course of your studies.

# Models: 
A crucial link between analysis and synthesis is the ability to create an appropriate
mathematical or computational model of the thing (“system”) that you are creating
(“designing”). In this context a model is a representation of the system by one or more
mathematical equations: typically, by a set of equations. Such a model is required so that the
page 2 of 11 pages
equations can be solved analytically or computationally to demonstrate or prove some
properties of the system that is being modelled.
The word “appropriate” is highly relevant. Part of the skill—or art—of the engineer is to be able
to separate the most important aspects of a problem from the less relevant facts to create a
relatively simple model of a system that nevertheless contains all the important features: for
example, the governing physical laws. Given sufficient time and other resources such as money, a
highly detailed and accurate model of some system could be created. Such an approach cannot
always be justified. It is more usual that time and other resources are constratined, so that the
“appropriate” model is one that captures only the most important governing equations and can
readily be solved.

# Simplifying assumptions: 
Various assumptions will be made based on an understanding of the
thing (“system”) that is being created (“designed”). The resulting set of equations, and
consequently the solution(s) of the equations, will therefore depend on the assumptions that are
made. It is therefore crucial that the assumptions made in developing the model are clearly
stated and justified. The solution of a mathematical model can only be interpreted with a
knowledge of the assumptions that were made.
It is important to appreciate that there is no single “correct” model of a system. Different
assumptions will be made depending on the reason for creating the model, required fidelity of
the model, available resources, etc. This will naturally lead to different models that have
different solutions. None will be intrinsically right or wrong; instead, all must be interpreted in
the context of the assumptions that were made in creating the model.
The questions in this assignment ask you to create models of systems. Question 1 asks for a
model of a mechatronic system that results when we follow the Systems Engineering
methodology that we examined in the lecture. Question 2 is focused on building an engineering
model of our line following robot from Assignment 2 as an illustration of the steps involved in
simulating such a system.
